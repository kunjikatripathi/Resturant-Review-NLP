RESTAURANT REVIEWS PREDICTION (NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING)
The purpose of this analysis is to build a prediction model to predict whether a review of the restaurant is positive or negative.

Dataset: Restaurant_Reviews.tsv is a dataset from Kaggle datasets which consists of 1000 reviews on a restaurant.

To build a model to predict if the review is positive or negative, the following steps are performed.

1- Importing Dataset 
2- Preprocessing Dataset
3- Vectorization 
4- Training and Classification 
5- Analysis Conclusion

1) Importing Dataset-Importing the Restaurant Review dataset using pandas library.

2) Preprocessing Dataset- 
     Each review undergoes a preprocessing step, where all the vague information is removed. 
         1- Removing the Stopwords, numeric and special characters.
         2- Normalizing each review using the approach of stemming.

3) Vectorization- 
     From the cleaned dataset, potential features are extracted and are converted to the numerical format. The vectorization techniques are used to convert textual data to a     numerical format. Using vectorization, a matrix is created where each column represents a feature and each row represents an individual review

4) Training and Classification -
     Further the data is splitted into training and testing set using Cross Validation technique. This data is used as input to classification algorithm.

5) Analysis and Conclusion-
      In this study, an attempt has been made to classify sentiment analysis for restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques.
      Evaluation metrics used here are accuracy, precision and recall.
